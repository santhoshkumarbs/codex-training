# Lab 3: React TypeScript Registration Form

## Objective
Use Codex to build a production-ready registration form with React, TypeScript, and modern form handling.

## Requirements

Build a registration system that includes:

1. **Form Fields**
   - Email (validated)
   - Password (strength requirements)
   - Confirm Password (must match)
   - Username (unique check)
   - Terms acceptance (required)
   - Optional profile fields

2. **Validation**
   - Real-time field validation
   - Schema validation with Zod
   - Custom validators
   - Async username availability check
   - Password strength meter

3. **User Experience**
   - Accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA)
   - Mobile responsive
   - Loading states
   - Error messages
   - Success feedback
   - Progress indicator

4. **State Management**
   - React Hook Form for form state
   - Context API for global state
   - Local storage persistence

5. **Testing**
   - Unit tests with Jest
   - Component tests with React Testing Library

6. **Performance**
   - Code splitting
   - Lazy loading
   - Optimistic updates
   - Debounced validation

## Codex Prompts Progression

### Step 1: Project Setup
```
Create a React TypeScript project with Vite, configure ESLint, Prettier, and Tailwind CSS
```

### Step 2: Form Schema
```
Define Zod schemas for registration form with email, password, username, and terms validation
```

### Step 3: Form Component
```
Create RegistrationForm component using React Hook Form with Zod resolver and TypeScript types
```

### Step 4: Custom Inputs
```
Build custom input components with error states, labels, and accessibility attributes
```

### Step 5: Password Strength
```
Implement password strength meter with visual feedback and requirements checklist
```

### Step 6: Async Validation
```
Add async username availability check with debouncing and loading states
```

### Step 7: Multi-Step Form
```
Convert to multi-step form with progress indicator and step navigation
```

### Step 8: State Management
```
Implement form state persistence with Context API and local storage
```

### Step 9: Testing Suite
```
Create comprehensive test suite with unit tests, integration tests, and accessibility tests
```

### Step 10: Performance Optimization
```
Add code splitting, lazy loading, and performance optimizations
```

## Suggested Target Structure

```
src/
├── components/
│   └── RegistrationForm.tsx
├── hooks/
├── schemas/
├── services/
├── utils/
└── App.tsx
```

The checked-in starter is intentionally minimal. Use Codex to evolve it toward a
structure like the one above.

## Technologies

- React 18
- TypeScript 5
- Vite
- React Hook Form
- Zod
- Tailwind CSS
- Jest + React Testing Library

## Form Features to Implement

### Basic Fields
```typescript
interface RegistrationData {
  email: string;
  username: string;
  password: string;
  confirmPassword: string;
  firstName?: string;
  lastName?: string;
  phoneNumber?: string;
  dateOfBirth?: Date;
  country?: string;
  newsletter?: boolean;
  terms: boolean;
}
```

### Validation Rules
- Email: Valid format, not disposable
- Username: 3-20 chars, alphanumeric + underscore
- Password: 8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number, special
- Phone: International format support
- Age: Must be 18+

### Accessibility Requirements
- Proper ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader support
- Focus management
- Error announcements
- High contrast support

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All form fields validate correctly
- [ ] Async username check works
- [ ] Password strength meter functional
- [ ] Form persists on refresh
- [ ] All tests pass (>90% coverage)
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] Performance score >90

## Advanced Challenges

1. Add OAuth integration (Google, GitHub)
2. Implement CAPTCHA verification
3. Add file upload for avatar
4. Create email verification flow
5. Add internationalization (i18n)

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Type checking
npm run type-check

# Linting
npm run lint

# Unit tests
npm run test

# Coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Build
npm run build
```

### Advanced Testing (Optional)

Use Codex to add E2E and accessibility testing:

```
Add Playwright for E2E testing with test:e2e script
Add axe-core for accessibility testing with test:a11y script
```

## Example Codex Session

```
