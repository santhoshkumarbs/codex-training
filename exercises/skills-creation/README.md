# Lab 5: Skills Creation

## Objective
Use Codex to create a custom skill that generates conventional commit messages following team standards.

## Background

Agent Skills are reusable instruction bundles that extend Codex's capabilities. They follow the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) specification and can be invoked explicitly with `$skill-name` or implicitly based on task matching.

## Requirements

Build a skill that:

1. **Analyzes Git Changes**
   - Reads staged files and their diffs
   - Understands the scope of changes
   - Identifies file types and patterns

2. **Generates Conventional Commits**
   - Follows the [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org) specification
   - Suggests appropriate type: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
   - Includes scope when applicable
   - Writes clear, concise descriptions

3. **Team Customization**
   - Configurable commit types
   - Custom scopes for your project
   - Optional issue/ticket number integration

## Starting Point

Use `$skill-creator` to bootstrap your skill:

```bash
$skill-creator Create a skill for generating conventional commit messages
```

## Skill Structure

Your completed skill should have this structure:

```
~/.agents/skills/commit-gen/
├── SKILL.md          # Required: YAML frontmatter + instructions
├── references/       # Optional: commit examples
│   └── conventions.md
└── assets/           # Optional: templates
    └── template.txt
```

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Create the Skill Skeleton

```bash
$skill-creator Create a skill called commit-gen that helps generate conventional commit messages by analyzing staged changes
```

Review the generated SKILL.md and customize as needed.

### Step 2: Define the Skill Metadata

Edit `~/.agents/skills/commit-gen/SKILL.md`:

```yaml
---
name: commit-gen
description: >
  Generate conventional commit messages. Use when asked to write a
  commit message, create a commit, or when user runs git commit.
  Triggers: "commit message", "write commit", "generate commit".
---

# Commit Message Generator

Generate conventional commit messages following project standards.

## Workflow

1. **Analyze Changes**: Run `git diff --staged` to see what's staged
2. **Identify Type**: Determine the commit type from the changes
3. **Extract Scope**: Identify the component/module affected
4. **Generate Message**: Create a clear, concise commit message

## Commit Types

- **feat**: New feature for the user
- **fix**: Bug fix for the user
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Formatting, no code change
- **refactor**: Code restructuring, no behavior change
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **chore**: Build process, dependencies

## Output Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

<optional body>

<optional footer>
```
```

### Step 3: Add Reference Material

Create `~/.agents/skills/commit-gen/references/conventions.md`:

```markdown
# Conventional Commits Quick Reference

## Examples

### Feature
```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 login support

Implements Google and GitHub OAuth providers with
automatic account linking for existing users.

Closes #123
```

### Bug Fix
```
fix(api): handle null response from payment gateway

Check for null before accessing response properties
to prevent 500 errors during checkout.

Fixes #456
```

### Refactor
```
refactor(database): migrate to connection pooling

Replace individual connections with HikariCP pool
for improved performance under load.
```

## Scope Guidelines

Use lowercase, typically matching:
- Directory names (api, web, cli)
- Feature areas (auth, payment, search)
- Component names (button, modal, form)
```

### Step 4: Test Your Skill

1. Stage some changes in a Git repository:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

2. Invoke the skill:
   ```bash
   $commit-gen
   ```

3. Alternatively, test implicit invocation:
   ```bash
   codex "Write a commit message for my staged changes"
   ```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Skill created at `~/.agents/skills/commit-gen/`
- [ ] SKILL.md has valid YAML frontmatter
- [ ] Description triggers match commit-related queries
- [ ] Skill correctly analyzes staged changes
- [ ] Generated messages follow conventional format
- [ ] Messages are clear and accurate

## Advanced Challenges

1. **Issue Integration**: Add support for extracting issue numbers from branch names
2. **Multi-language Support**: Generate commit messages in different languages
3. **Breaking Changes**: Automatically detect and flag breaking changes
4. **Changelog Integration**: Generate changelog entries alongside commits
5. **Team Templates**: Support multiple commit templates for different projects

## Sharing Your Skill

### Project-Level Sharing

Copy your skill to the project's `.agents/skills/` directory:

```bash
cp -r ~/.agents/skills/commit-gen .agents/skills/
git add .agents/skills/commit-gen
git commit -m "chore: add commit-gen skill for team"
```

### Skill Catalog Submission

For wider distribution, consider contributing to the [Skills Catalog](https://github.com/openai/skills).

## Tips

- **Keep instructions focused**: Skills work best with clear, specific workflows
- **Use triggers wisely**: Good trigger phrases help Codex know when to invoke your skill
- **Test implicit invocation**: Verify your description matches user intent
- **Add examples**: Reference files with examples improve output quality
- **Iterate**: Refine your skill based on real usage

## Comparison: Skills vs Custom Prompts

| Aspect | Skills | Custom Prompts |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Structure | Directory with SKILL.md + resources | Single text file |
| Invocation | `$skill-name` or implicit | Manual copy/paste |
| Sharing | Git-friendly, team-distributable | Single file |
| Resources | Can include scripts, templates, docs | Text only |
| Best for | Complex workflows | Simple templates |
